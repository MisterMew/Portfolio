                <p>
                    The Heart of the Forest is a 2.5D adventure platformer about a little red-capped mushroom, who is
                    tasked with finding all of the lost heart fragments and returning them to the forest god to prevent
                    the corruption from taking over.
                    <br>
                    The player must explore different areas using their various abilities in order to find a singular
                    heart fragment, and then return it to the village. Once all four fragments have been found, the game
                    is complete.

                            The <b>player’s health</b> was quickly set up, but served as the core functionality anyway.
                            The lives were stored as an <b>integer</b> and controlled/clamped in <b>Update()</b> based
                            on the <b>maxLivesvariable</b> - that way designers could easily test and configure what was
                            best. Thefunctions that <b>Add, Remove, and Restore lives</b> were all simply modifying the
                            currentLives variable.

                            The <b>poison puddle</b> was incredibly simple, when a collision is detected, if it is the
                            Player, then removes X amount of health. This gave the designers the ability to decide
                            whether a poison puddle/pool was <b>instant death</b>, or <b>gradually deducts</b> from the
                            player's health.

                        <p>
                            The <b>moving platforms</b> were one of the more difficult systems. My idea was to create a
                            <b>transit system</b> that takes in an <b>array of transform.position</b> for the
                            <b>obj_platform</b> to move between. Simple enough. The complicated bits came with all the
                            validation checks, making sure the platforms performed as intended when they were set to
                            move autonomously or with player input, and then whether the player was grounded on them or
                            not, as well as checking which point the platform is currently at and telling it whether to
                            stop or keep going.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Rotating Blocks</h4>
                        <p>
                            Rotating blocks were nothing special, I simply tell the <b>target game object</b> to rotate
                            using a Quaternion, using an integer variable representing the <b>degrees per second</b>. I 
                            made sure to have a <b>boolean</b> that allows designers to choose if they want the platform
                            rotate at a steady rate, or incrementally stopping.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Bounce Pad</h4>
                        <p>
                            I had a lot of fun playing with the bounce pads and got to try a few different methods. I 
                            found I got the best results by using a <b>raycast</b> between the player and the bounce pad
                            to check for the <b>point of contact</b>, and then applying the actual bounce mechanic in the 
                            direction of the bounce pad.
                            <br>
                            The player bounces <b>higher</b> with each bounce up to a certain point, and will have the 
                            values resset when in contact with the ground. The <b>calculate force</b> is used with the 
                            boucne direction to apply a <b>velocity</b> to the player. 
                        </p>
                        <br><pre><code>
private void Bounce(Vector2 bounceDirection)
{
    tempBounceForce += bounceForceIncrement; //Multiplier that makes bouncing higher incrementally
    tempBounceForce = Mathf.Clamp(tempBounceForce, 0, bounceMaxForce); //Clamp the bounce force

    pRb.velocity = bounceDirection * (tempBounceForce * 2F); //Add velocity to the player
}
                        </code></pre>

                        <h4>Two-way Passable</h4>
                        <p>
                            The system was created to be applied to any object and worked well with other systems.
                            Every <b>Update()</b> there is a check to see if <b>playerOnPlatform == true</b> and if the 
                            <b>down input</b> is triggered. If both conditions have been met, then the target platforms 
                            collider is disabled and coroutine is called to re-enable the collider after 0.5 seconds.
                            <br><br>
                            I didn't run into any troubles with this method, the timing was perfect and no issues were 
                            found, however I could seem to find a good way to apply pixel-correction when the player 
                            collided with the corners of the platform.

                            The light sensitive <b>mushroom platforms</b> consist of two basic functions: <b>grow</b>

                            <br>
                            The base of the platforms (<i>mushroom stem</i>) will respond when contact with light is
                            <b>entered</b> or <b>exited</b>, and begin a coroutine which grows/shrinks them, and disables
                            the collider when shrunk.

                            Setting up the functionality for every time a <b>button was pressed</b> was straightforward, only 
                            requiring access to certain canvas elements and scene indexes to switch between them.

                            The entire options menu was a little bit differemt, in order to not repeat any code, I 
                            had to <b>cache the most recent menu</b> that was opened, and then try to enable it when pressing 
                            the back button within any of the <b>sub-options</b>.
                        </p>
                        <br><pre><code>
private GameObject latestMenuCache = null; //Caches the last accessed/current menu

public void ReturnToOptions()  {
latestMenuCache.gameObject.SetActive(false); //Gets the cached menu
menuManager.optionsMenuUI.SetActive(true);
}
                        </code></pre><br>
                        <p>
                            The most <b>challenging aspect</b> of the GUI was handling everything relating to the 
                            <b>Graphics Settings</b>. I found it quite difficult trying to get the dropdowns and other elements
                            to load and sync up with the realtime changes, as well as trying to make sure that the functionality
                            was properly working.
                            <br><br>
                            Playing with these systems was a first, and I'm glad I took on the challenge because not only am I
                            proud of my achievements, I also learnt quite a bit about the features Unity allows us to use in 
                            relation to grapphics.

                <h3>ABOUT THE COORDINATION</h3>
                <h4>Coordinating the Project</h4>
                <p>
                    I was allocated the team Project Coordinator. It was an interesting experience and I learnt alot 
                    about how to handle individuals within each discpline, as well as what it means to actually fill
                    the role. 
                    <br>
                    I made sure to keep on top of documentation, including writing out meeting agendas and
                    notes for the team to follow.
                    <br>
                    Keeping up to date with what everyone was doing while also not getting to involved in every 
                    discipline was also a challenge, I did catch myself needing to step back on occaision to give
                    others the opportunity to work things out independantly. Unfortunely, I did have to take some major
                    risks during the 7th week of development, the level design simply wasn't past its drawing stages
                    and the rest of the team being notciably upset with the lack of progress - I managed to step in and
                    guide the designers down a different path which ultimately worked - the result is the one that has 
                    made it into the final game.
                    <br><br>
                    Generally speaking, the role of Project Coordinator was challenging but incredibly rewarding, I would
                    love to fill those shoes again someday to gain even more experience and help others look at things
                    from a different perspective.

                        <h4>Itch.io</h4>
                        <p>I helped with some of the design for the Itch.io page, using custom CSS to alter some of the
                            pages elements. The background was a difficult task as it consisted of two separate images
                            that had to be set and calculated to dynamically adjust with the pages resolution, and the
                            hover effect when the mouse is over the images, were the major visual tweaks I had done.

                        <p>
                            I created all the trello boards for the team at the beginning of alpha. I set up tags and
                            colour coded each discipline to help with organisation, automated certain cards so that tags
                            are automatically added when a card is created or moved, and also linked important documents
                            and created a submission checklist that can always be referred back to.
                            <br>
                            I contributed to a lot of the maintenance within the _Major Production: Main Board and the
                            Programming Board, but don’t deserve all the credit. The programmers all did their share of
                            maintaining the programming board.
